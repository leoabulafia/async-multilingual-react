<h1>Async Multilingual React</h1>
<h2>Asynchronous Multilingual single-page app with React & Redux</h2>
<p>Offering content in several languages definitely add complexity to the process of development of any web site.This template intends to be a solution or at least a suggestion when working with React and Redux.</p>
<p>This is a template for a multilingual single-page web application. It contains a top navigation bar with buttons and links to different pages, making possible to switch instantly languages in every section of the web, without redirecting to the homepage.</p>
<p>The app uses React 16 generated by create-react-app library. The state of the application is managed by Redux. React-Router 4 helps to dynamic routing the SPA. Lastly, Material-UI is used to minimal style the app.</p>
<p>Although is easier to load the texts synchronously, I needed an async solution for a project I was working. This template can be very handy when dealing with a server side.</p>
